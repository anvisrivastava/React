State:
Data that chmages as the user interacs with the application
When the data changes, react will update the content on the screen automatically
This is one and only way we can change the that content reacts show

function App(){
    const [cricketCount, setCricketCount] =useState(0);
    const handleClick =() =>{
       setCricketCount(cricketCount +1)
       //setCricketCount is nothing but the function setter function used to update our piece of State
       //cricketCount the piece of Statewhich instial is 0 and will update over the time
    }
    return(
        <div>
            <button onClick ={handleClick}>Add cricketers</button>
            <h1>Added the cricketers counts is{cricketCount}</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
export default App


1) useState() ->define a piece of state using the react hook(function) called useState function
2) useState(0) -> we have to provide the value to the useState function.this is the default,starting value of our state
3) {cricketCount} ->use the state value to show the output the user
4) setCricketCount(cricketCount + 1)-> when the user do something,update the piece of state and it will render in the component
