1)single page application
SPA will have the main page loaded once and then the sub page sections will be changing without any refresh
SPA is the modern way of the web development which will be fast and responsive

2)multi page application
Entire page will be getting reloaded everytime
traditional approach



Notes to confugure the Routes

1) Thie first step to configure the router is giving a top level or hige order component names <BorowserRouter>
2) All the routers and components will be wrapped inside the <BrowserRouter> component as it will store
the clear URL's internally, using which we actually route through all the components means entire application

Meaning route -> navigating from one page to another page

a) <BrowserRouter
example:
ReactDOM.creatRoot(el).render(
<BrowserRouter>
<App/>
</BrowserRouter>
);

b) We need to import import { Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';

c)to  show the child routes into our application we have to use >outlet />




-----------------------------------------------

index attribute which will refers to the parent Route "index attribute will point the  route to
 its parent default value will be true for the index in the Routes <Route index element ={<Home />} />

 d) contect and useOutletContext(): passing data to the child component

 If wanted to sharethe sate, like sharing the data from the child component we have to use an callled "context"
 that can we used in the <Outlet /> component<Outlet context -
 {object} />
 with the context attribute we can pass the data as the Object Literal

 The object is passed to the child component and to refer the assed data inside the child component we have 
 to use useOutletContext()hook(function)


//useOutletContext() hook help to get the data which is passed with the "context" attribute inside the <Outlet /> component
